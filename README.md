OPRMT™ — The Open Prompt Standard

OPRMT™ is a unified, structured, and universal framework designed to standardize the way AI prompts are created, documented, and deployed. The goal is to bring clarity, repeatability, and professional engineering practices to prompt design across all GPT/LLM platforms.

This repository contains the official specification, documentation, governance model, and reference implementations for the OPRMT™ standard.
