1\. Purpose

This governance document defines how decisions are proposed, reviewed, approved, and implemented in the OPRMT™ Open Prompt Standard.  
The goal is to ensure the standard remains:

Technically rigorous

Transparent

Community-driven

Consistent across versions

Protected under formal trademark rules

This document serves as the authoritative decision-making protocol for all contributors, maintainers, and overseers of the standard.

2\. Governance Model Overview

OPRMT™ uses a three-tier governance system:

1\. Standard Maintainers  
Core maintainers responsible for approving specification changes and releases.

2\. Working Group Contributors  
Community members who propose improvements, file issues, and contribute documentation, examples, or tooling.

3\. ImperialTurf LLC Oversight (Trademark & Direction)  
Final authority on branding, trademark usage, and major direction of the standard.

This model ensures community participation while maintaining brand integrity.

\---

4.4 Versioning & Releases

The standard follows a semantic versioning model, adapted for open specifications:

Major (2.0, 3.0…)

Minor (1.1, 1.2…)  
Enhancements, new optional sections, clarifications, improved examples.

Patch (1.0.1, 1.0.2…)  
Typographical fixes, minor corrections, formatting.

All released versions are stored in /spec/versions/.

Each working group is led by a Maintainer.
